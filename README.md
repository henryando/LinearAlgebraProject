# Linear Algebra for Data Science

## Overview

We are developing a linear algrebra course with applications to data science, based on the previous MAT227 but based in Python instead of Mathematica. This repository includes the old Mathematica notebooks for reference in the "Matrices and Geometry" folder, as well as the new Jupyter and Python resources in the "Python" folder.

## Using Python and Jupyter

Currently, we do not believe we will need to use any Python libraries except those which come standard in all Python installations (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.). It would be ideal if the students and staff all used Python 3.7 for the sake of consistency, although most of the course will likely be backwards compatible with 2.7. If it would be helpful, I can include instructions for installing Python.

Using Jupyter is fairly straightforward. Assuming Jupyter is installed (and I believe that it also comes standard in most Python installations), you start it by navigating to the top level directory for your project in the command line (within Jupyter you can navigate down but not up), then run

> `jupyter notebook`

This starts a jupyter server and opens an editor in your browser. From the editor, you can open jupyter notebooks (file extension `.ipynb`), work on them, and save them. Then you can quit the session by clicking on logout in the corner.

## Using git and Github

Everyone who wants to contribute to this project should make an account on github and tell me their usernames so I can add them as contributors to the project.
